# 3D reconstruction using SphericaTetra algorithm

## Installation procedure

1. **Load and install the `neuroshape` algorithm package**

   In the upper directory of the 'neuroshape' folder, open the terminal and execute the following instructions to install the 'neuroshape' algorithm packageï¼š

   ```bash
   pip install -e .

2. **Dataset preparation**

   Our data set is the BraTs2021 data set, make sure you have downloaded and extracted it to the specified location

3. **Modify the data set path in the demo.py file**
   In the demo.py file, change the data set file path to your local path

4. **Run 3D reconstruction**
   After modifying the path, you can directly run demo.py to start the 3D reconstruction process
